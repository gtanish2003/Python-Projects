# Diwali Sales Analysis

The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze sales data during the Diwali festival using Python and EDA techniques. It involves exploring the dataset to answer questions such as:

What are the top-selling products during Diwali?
How do sales vary across different product categories?
What are the most popular discounts offered during Diwali?
How does pricing affect sales during the festival?

By performing exploratory data analysis, we can visualize the data, identify trends, patterns, and correlations, and extract meaningful insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

The dataset used for this project contains sales data during the Diwali festival. It includes information about various products, their categories, prices, discounts, and sales volumes.

As this dataset is hypothetical, you can create your own dataset or use any publicly available sales data for analysis.
